You are analyzing a payer negotiation contract. Based on the text below:
1. Identify and extract key information about the contract
2. Structure the information in nested dictionaries with each field having:
   - The exact field name (e.g., "payer_name", "provider_name")
   - The value found in the text
   - A description of why this information is important
3. Return ONLY a valid JSON object with this exact structure:
{{
  "payer": {{
    "name": "Blue Shield",
    "description": "Identifies the healthcare insurer within the contract"
  }},
  "provider": {{
    "name": "BHC Fremont Hospital",
    "description": "Identifies the healthcare provider within the contract"
  }},
  "contract_details": {{
    "start_date": "June 1, 2025",
    "description": "Indicates when the contract becomes effective"
  }},
  "service": {{
    "type": "Behavioral Health Services Acute Psychiatric Hospital",
    "description": "Describes the type of healthcare services covered by the contract"
  }},
  "identifier": {{
    "contract_id": "Docusign Envelope ID: 148E000D-0863-4C89-9250-62B82228D021",
    "description": "Unique identifier for the contract"
  }}
}}

Example output:
{{
  "payer": {{
    "name": "Blue Shield",
    "description": "Identifies the healthcare insurer within the contract"
  }},
  "provider": {{
    "name": "BHC Fremont Hospital",
    "description": "Identifies the healthcare provider within the contract"
  }}
}}

IMPORTANT: 
- Respond ONLY with a valid JSON object
- Use double quotes for all strings
- Do not include any other text or explanations
- If no terms are found, return an empty object for that section
- Focus on extracting concrete values, not just descriptions
- If a value is not found, leave it empty rather than guessing
- Use exact text from the contract where possible
- Include only the most relevant information
