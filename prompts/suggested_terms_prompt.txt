You are analyzing a payer negotiation contract. Based on the text below:
1. Look for values related to these specific terms:
   {TERMS}
2. For each term that you find, extract the exact value from the text
3. Return ONLY a valid JSON object with this exact structure:
{{
  "ID": "",
  "TITLE": "",
  "TYPE": "",
  "PAYER NAME": "",
  "PLAN TYPE": "",
  "EXTERNAL ID": "",
  "PROVIDER ENTITY": "",

- Focus on extracting concrete values, not just descriptions
- If a value is not found, leave it empty rather than guessing
